use arrays to represent binary numbers and mimic the plus operation

TWO N-DIGIT BINARY NUMBERS ADD ALGORITHM
(A, B: .length = n; C: .length = n + 1)
oldkey = 0
for i = 1 to n
    key = (A[i], B[i] == 1, 1) ? 1 : 0
    if key = 0
        C[i] = A[i] + B[i}
    else
        C[i] = oldkey
    oldkey = key
C[n+1] = oldkey
